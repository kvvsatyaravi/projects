# description
A disaster is a serious disruption in the functioning of a community or a society,
which exceed the ability of the affected community or the society to cope using its own
resources; for instance, there is a widespread human, economic, environmental and
material impact due to turbulent cyclones. Disaster Management refers to conservation of
lives and property during a natural and man-made disaster. Disaster management plans are
multi-layered and are planned to address issues such as floods, hurricanes, fires, mass
